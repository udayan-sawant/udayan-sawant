<h3 align="center">🚀 Embracing the Challenge, Innovating with Purpose - one LLM at a time. 🚀</h3>

Hi, I’m Udayan Sawant – a Generative AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and create. With 6+ years of experience at the intersection of Data Engineerg & AI, deep learning, and innovation, I design and deploy next-gen solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible.


🧠 LLM & Foundation Model Specialist: From fine-tuning large language models to orchestrating multimodal AI systems, I work with cutting-edge architectures to solve real-world problems. I build tailored GenAI applications that drive automation, personalization, and enhanced decision-making.

🛠️ AI Systems Builder: Skilled in developing custom pipelines for model training, evaluation, and deployment. Leveraging tools like Hugging Face, LangChain, and vector databases - Elasticsearch, PineCone, I craft scalable solutions that integrate seamlessly with business workflows.

🧪 Experimentation at Scale: I thrive in rapid prototyping environments—experimenting with prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and model optimization techniques to deliver high-impact results, fast.

🌐 Cloud-Native AI Deployment: Proficient in deploying AI workloads on cloud platforms (Azure, GCP), leveraging GPU-powered compute for training and inference. I build robust, production-ready AI APIs and services with performance and security in mind.

🤖 Driving AI Innovation: Passionate about human-AI interaction, ethical AI practices, and building explainable, reliable systems. Whether it's enhancing customer experiences or reimagining internal processes, I bring a product-focused mindset to every solution.

📚 Constantly Evolving: In the fast-paced world of AI, I stay ahead by learning continuously—exploring new research, experimenting with open-source tools, and contributing to the AI community.
